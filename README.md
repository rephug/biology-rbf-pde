# Biology-Aware RBF PDE Prototype

**A meshless, discontinuity-friendly PDE solver for modeling tumor growth and cell behavior in complex biological microenvironments.**

---

## 1. Project Overview

This repository presents an **integrated PDE framework** that uses **radial basis function (RBF)** methods to solve **reaction–diffusion**-type problems with **adaptive node placement** in regions of high biological complexity (e.g., tumor boundaries). It incorporates:

- **Discontinuity handling** near sharp transitions (like tumor–tissue interfaces)  
- **Time-stepping** for simple PDEs (reaction–diffusion, Turing-like systems)  
- A **naïve parallel approach** (using `mpi4py`) for demonstration  
- **Biology-based “hotspot” detection** that refines node distribution where cell density or chem gradients are high

**Why does it matter?** In many cancer models, the boundary between tumor and healthy tissue is highly complex—cells experience abrupt changes in ECM stiffness, oxygen levels, etc. Traditional mesh-based PDE methods may require complex re-meshing to follow these changes. **RBF-FD** (Radial Basis Function - Finite Differences) can adapt more flexibly, placing extra nodes only where needed, preserving computational resources.

---

## 2. Key Features & Inspiration

1. **Biology-Aware Node Placement**  
   - Dynamically refine nodes where “biological fields” (cell density, chemical gradients) indicate large gradients or discontinuities.

2. **Local RBF-FD Laplacian**  
   - Uses a toy weighting system (e.g., center node `-4`, neighbors `+1`) as a placeholder. Real applications could implement more robust RBF-FD stencils.

3. **Time-Dependent PDE**  
   - Example: A simplified reaction–diffusion (Turing-like) system with Euler forward time-stepping. Demonstrates how cells or chemical species might evolve over time.

4. **Naïve Parallelism**  
   - Splits domain points across MPI ranks. This is not HPC-optimized but serves as a conceptual stepping stone to distributed PDE solves.

5. **Quantum & Relativity Inspirations (See below)**  
   - The conceptual backdrop includes quantum-inspired thinking about “operators” and “transformations” that preserve key invariants, offering a fresh angle on multi-scale biology.

**Mechanical labs like Weaver, Wirtz, and Discher** have shown that mechanical cues (ECM stiffness, traction forces) crucially guide tumor progression. This code aims to **simulate** such phenomena by embedding them into PDE boundary/data constraints.

## 3. Installation and Usage

### 3.1 Dependencies

- **Python 3.7+**  
- `numpy`  
- `scipy`  
- `mpi4py` (for parallel runs, optional if you only run single-process)

You can install these via pip:
```bash
pip install numpy scipy mpi4py
```

### 3.2 Cloning and Running

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/biology-rbf-pde.git
   cd biology-rbf-pde
   ```

2. **Run single-process**:
   ```bash
   python integrated_biological_rbf.py
   ```
   You’ll see console output describing steps and final PDE results for a small toy problem.

3. **Run in parallel** (e.g., 4 processes):
   ```bash
   mpiexec -np 4 python integrated_biological_rbf.py
   ```
   The code slices the domain among ranks, each rank builds local RBF stencils, and we do a naive gather at the end.

## 4. How the Code Works

1. **Domain Generation**  
   - Creates random 2D coordinates in `[0,1]^2`. In real usage, you can import or generate structured points or sample from a geometry.

2. **Biology Fields**  
   - Placeholders (`chem_grad`, `cell_density`) are random arrays. A “discontinuity detector” checks these values relative to their mean, marking “hotspots.”

3. **Adaptive Node Placement**  
   - Where a discontinuity is found, we add refined nodes around that point (a small ring of extra nodes). We also adjust RBF parameters (`shape_parameter`).

4. **Local RBF-FD**  
   - Builds a **sparse Laplacian** matrix for each rank’s local nodes, using a simplified weighting. Real RBF-FD would solve local linear systems for accurate derivative stencils.

5. **Time Integration**  
   - A minimal **Euler** forward step updates PDE variables (`u`, `v`) for each node. You can expand or replace with more advanced PDE systems or solvers.

6. **Parallel Domain Decomposition**  
   - Splits points among MPI ranks. Each rank sees only a portion of the domain, assembles local PDE operators. At the end, data is gathered to rank 0 for output.

**Result**: A **toy demonstration** that can be extended with actual mechanical data, HPC domain decomposition, or more sophisticated PDE mechanics.

## 5. Parallel Thinking with Quantum Mechanics

One unique aspect of this project is the **inspiration** taken from **quantum mechanics** and **relativistic** ideas:

- **Quantum-Like Operators**  
  - In quantum systems, we describe states via wavefunctions in Hilbert space, evolved by operators (Hamiltonians). Similarly, a PDE solution can be seen as a “state” in function space, acted upon by “operator-based” RBF stencils.  
- **Lorentz or Scale Invariance**  
  - Relativity preserves intervals in spacetime. Analogously, we might want to preserve “mechanical invariants” across scales (cell scale → tissue scale). While not physically the same, the concept of transformations preserving fundamental structure can guide multi-scale PDE design.  
- **Transformer-Like Attention**  
  - In the future, we might embed an attention mechanism to adapt PDE stencils or focus on crucial boundaries—much like an NLP model “attends” to important tokens.  
- **Biology**  
  - Tumors exhibit “phase transitions” or “discontinuities” reminiscent of sharp quantum leaps (in a metaphorical sense). Incorporating an “operator formalism” can unify discrete cell changes with continuous PDE fields.

**Why mention this?**  
This code is not a literal quantum or relativistic solver, but the *mindset* of invariants, symmetrical transformations, and attention-like focusing shaped the approach to node placement and PDE structure.

## 6. Future Directions

- **Real Mechanical Datasets**: Plug in ECM stiffness or traction force measurements from labs like Weaver or Discher to drive node refinement.  
- **Accurate RBF-FD Stencils**: Replace the toy –4/+1 weighting with genuine local RBF solves for Laplacian or more complex operators.  
- **Viscoelastic or Multi-Phase PDE**: If you incorporate time-dependent ECM remodeling or multiple cell species, the PDE system becomes more biologically realistic.  
- **Agent-Based Coupling**: Combine with discrete cell models to track individual or sub-population behaviors while PDE handles bulk signals.  
- **Transformer Integration**: Explore attention-based PDE approaches or “neural operators” to learn PDE behavior from data, potentially capturing non-local influences.  
- **Quantum or Relativistic Formalism**: If truly merging quantum computing or Minkowski-like invariants, build a specialized operator that enforces certain symmetrical constraints across scales.
